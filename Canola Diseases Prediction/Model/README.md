## **CANOLA DISEASE CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The goal of this project is to classify images of Canola plant leaves into healthy and diseased categories using various deep learning models. The purpose is to develop an accurate model that can assist in identifying plant diseases early, aiding in timely interventions for agricultural management.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of images depicting two classes: Diseased and Healthy canola plants.
