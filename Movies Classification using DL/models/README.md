# Movie Genre Predictor 🍿<br>

## 🎯 Goal<br>

The Movie Genre Predictor is a project aimed at predicting the genres of movies based on textual information, such as movie descriptions or overviews. The goal is to build a model that can automatically assign appropriate genres to movies, facilitating better categorization and recommendation systems.<br>

## 🧵 Dataset<br>

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Millions of Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies) on Kaggle. It comprises extensive information about movies, including titles, overviews, genres, and other relevant details.

## 🧾 Description<br>

This project involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and predict movie genres. The model is trained on movie overviews, and various machine learning algorithms are employed for accurate genre prediction.<br>

## 🧮 What I Had Done<br>

1. **Data Preprocessing:**<br>
   - Cleaning and tokenization of movie overviews.<br>
   - Handling missing or irrelevant data.<br>

2. **Feature Engineering:**<br>
   - Utilizing TF-IDF or word embeddings for representing movie overviews.<br>

3. **Model Training:**<br>
   - Training Deep learning models on preprocessed text data.<br>

4. **Model Evaluation:**<br>
   - Evaluating models on test data.<br>
   - Comparing the performance of different models.<br>

## 🚀 Models Implemented<br>

- DL model 1<br>
- DL model 2<br>

## 📚 Libraries Needed<br>

1. Scikit-learn<br>
2. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)<br>
3. Pandas<br>
4. Matplotlib<br>
5. Seaborn<br>

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results<br>

- Word Clouds showcasing frequent terms in movie overviews.<br>
- Distribution of movie genres in the dataset.<br>

## 📈 Performance of the Models based on Accuracy Scores<br>

1. DL model 1 : 52%<br>
2. DL model 2 : 45%<br>

## 📢 Conclusion<br>

The Movie Genre Predictor project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting movie genres based on textual information. The Random Forest Classifier achieved a promising accuracy of 75.3%, providing a reliable method for automated movie genre assignment.<br>
