Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink (atrophy) and brain cells to die. 
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia â€” a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills 
that affects a person's ability to function independently. 
The disease is classified into different stages based on the severity of symptoms: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, 
Non Demented, and Very Mild Demented.
