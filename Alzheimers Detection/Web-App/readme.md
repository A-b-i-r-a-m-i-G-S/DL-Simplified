# Alzheimer's Detection Web Application

## Goal 🎯
The main goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly web application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using deep learning models. The application aims to assist healthcare professionals in accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in patients based on brain scan images.

## Model Used for the Web App 🧮
The web application utilizes a deep learning model trained for Alzheimer's detection. The model architecture includes convolutional, separable convolutional, batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and dense layers. It is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images representing different stages of Alzheimer's disease.


## Features of the Web App 🌐
- **Sample Image Display**: Displays a sample brain scan image for reference.
- **Upload MRI Scan**: Allows users to upload their MRI scan images for Alzheimer's detection.
- **Prediction Display**: Provides predictions for Alzheimer's disease based on the uploaded MRI scan images.
- **About Alzheimer's Disease**: Offers information about Alzheimer's disease, including its causes, symptoms, and stages.
