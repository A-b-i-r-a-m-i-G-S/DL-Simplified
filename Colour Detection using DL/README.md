## üí° Project Overview

In this project, we'll delve into the fascinating world of color detection using Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify ten different colors from images.

## Approach for this Project

### CNN Model

**Description:**
- Utilized a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies.

### VGG16 Model

**Description:**
- Employed the VGG16 architecture, known for its simplicity and effectiveness.
- VGG16 consists of 16 convolutional layers and is capable of capturing intricate features in images.

### ResNet50 Model

**Description:**
- Implemented the ResNet50 architecture, featuring residual connections.
- ResNet50's residual blocks mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, enabling training of deeper networks.
