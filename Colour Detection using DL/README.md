## üåà Colour Detection using DL (#527)


## üí° Goal

In this project, we'll delve into the fascinating world of color detection using Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify ten different colors from images.

## üìä Dataset Exploration

We've sourced our dataset from [Color Dataset for Color Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adikurniawan/color-dataset-for-color-recognition). This dataset contains 10 class of color, each color class contains 25 images.

## üßæ Description
The project aims to create a color detection system using deep learning techniques. It involves identifying ten different colors from images. The dataset used for training and testing contains images labeled with various colors. 

## üßÆ What I had done!
### üîç Data Preprocessing

Ensuring uniformity in image shapes and enhancing color contrast to extract meaningful features for our models.

### üß† Model Selection

We're employing the latest DL architectures for our color detection task:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Known for its process in image classification.
2. **VGG16**: A state-of-the-art architecture with deep convolutional layers.

## üìà Performance Evaluation

Let's visualize the accuracy scores of our models:

| Model      | Accuracy | Loss    |
|------------|----------|---------|
| CNN        | 90%      | 0.326   |
| VGG16      | 82.5%    | 0.154   |
| ResNet50   | 87.5%    | 0.987   |


## üöÄ Conclusion

1. **CNN Model**: With an accuracy of 90% and a low loss of 0.326, it's the clear winner in color detection.
2. **VGG16 Model**: While respectable at 82.5% accuracy, it falls short compared to the CNN model.
3. **ResNet50 Model**: Despite its 87.5% accuracy, its higher loss indicates potential overfitting.

In conclusion, the CNN model emerges as the champion in accurately detecting colors from images.
