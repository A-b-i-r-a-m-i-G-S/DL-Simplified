### Tools and Frameworks used:
1. Python 3.9.16. (Programming language)
2. Tensorflow 2.10 (to design neural network architectures and use functional and sqquential models)
3. Pytorch (to design neural network architectures)
4. OpenCV (to perform image operations)
5. Pandas (to perfrom dataset preparation and data analysis)
6. Numpy (to perfrom mathematical computing on image data)
7. Matplotlib (to perform plotting operations)
8. Imutils (to perform image path operations)
9. Pathlib (to perform dataset path operations)
10. Warnings (to supress unnecessary warnings)

### Operations performed:
1. Image Processing.
2. Data Visualization.
3. Image data generation.
4. Deep Neural Network implementation.
5. Model training and evaluation
