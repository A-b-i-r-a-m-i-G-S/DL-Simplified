# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## üìù Abstract

Brain tumors are a serious medical condition affecting both children and adults, constituting 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Annually, around 11,700 people receive a brain tumor diagnosis, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics are crucial to improving patient life expectancy.

This project focuses on automated classification techniques using Deep Learning Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Transfer Learning (TL), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These techniques offer higher accuracy than manual classification, aiding doctors worldwide in efficient detection and classification of brain tumors[1][2][4][5][6][7][8].

## üåê Context

Brain tumors present complexities in size and location, requiring expertise for accurate analysis. Developing countries often face challenges due to a shortage of skilled doctors and insufficient knowledge about tumors. An automated system on the cloud can address these issues, providing a faster and more accessible solution[1][2][4][5][6][7][8].

## üîç Methodology

The proposed methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing publicly available datasets such as the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle[3] and the BRATS dataset[4][5][6][7][8].

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Applying techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the dataset[4][5][6][7][8].

3. **Model Development**: Constructing deep learning models using CNN, TL, and ANN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, and Inception[4][5][6][7][8].

4. **Model Training and Optimization**: Optimizing hyperparameters and employing techniques like transfer learning to improve model performance[4][5][6][7][8].

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score[4][5][6][7][8].

## üôå Acknowledgments

The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of the research community in the field of brain tumor detection using deep learning. The open-source datasets and repositories have been instrumental in the development of this project[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].
