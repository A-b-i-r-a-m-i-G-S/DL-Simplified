## Web Application for Brain Tumor Detection

### Goal üéØ
The main goal of is to provide a user-friendly web application for the detection of brain tumors using deep learning models. The purpose of the application is to assist healthcare professionals in accurately diagnosing brain tumors in patients.

### Model(s) used for the Web App üßÆ
The web application utilizes three main models for brain tumor detection:
1. **VGG16 Transfer Learning Model**: A pre-trained model on ImageNet, used for its superior performance in image classification tasks.
2. **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Specifically designed for brain tumor detection, trained on a dataset of brain MRI images.
3. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Based on TensorFlow**: An MLP architecture implemented using TensorFlow, serving as a simpler model for comparison.

### Video Demonstration üé•
