Brand Sentiment Analysis using NLP
🎯 Goal
The main goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on brand-related text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The purpose is to understand the sentiment expressed in textual content related to a brand, which can be valuable for businesses to gauge public opinion and improve their brand perception.

🧵 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tusharpaul2001/brand-sentiment-analysis-dataset . It comprises user-generated reviews and sentiments related to various brands. The dataset includes columns such as 'Brand', 'Category', 'Tweet', and 'Sentiment', providing a diverse set of textual data for sentiment analysis.

🧾 Description
This project utilizes LSTM and BERT models for brand sentiment analysis. The LSTM model captures sequential patterns in the text, while the BERT model leverages contextual embeddings for more accurate sentiment analysis.

🧮 What I had done!
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning and tokenization.
Handling missing or irrelevant data.
Feature Engineering:

Word embeddings for LSTM.
Token embeddings for BERT.
Model Training:

Training the LSTM model on preprocessed text data.
Fine-tuning the BERT model on the specific sentiment analysis task.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating models on test data.
Comparing the performance of LSTM and BERT models.
🚀 Models Implemented
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model
Why these models:

LSTM: Suitable for capturing sequential patterns in text data.
BERT: Utilizes contextual embeddings, providing a deeper understanding of language context.
